        <h1>Hey there! I'm Eamon. ☺️</h1>

<p>As a software developer, I enjoy using code to develop things. I like the process of bringing ideas to life, whether it's through a web application, a small script, or simply experimenting with new tools.</p>

<p>The reality is, I might not have years of experience yet, but I am genuinely willing to work hard, curious, and coachable. I'll pick things up quickly, ask questions, and keep getting better if I have the chance.</p>

<h2>Fun Fact + Unusual Skill</h2>

<p>I once negotiated a designer's price reduction from £150 to £30 for a jacket by pointing out a flaw (a loose thread), and offering to fix it myself in exchange for the price reduction. It turns out that I can also spot errors, find alternative solutions, and make the most of what's accessible in code thanks to my attention to detail and resourcefulness.</p>
